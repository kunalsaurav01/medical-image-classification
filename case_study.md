## 1. Problem Statement

### 1.1 Business Problem

Healthcare facilities face overwhelming volumes of medical imaging data requiring 
expert radiologist interpretation. Manual review is:
- Time-consuming (15-30 minutes per case)
- Expensive ($100-500 per study)
- Subject to human error and fatigue
- Limited by radiologist availability

### 1.2 Technical Challenges

- High-dimensional medical image data (224×224×3 = 150,528 features)
- Class imbalance in medical datasets
- Need for both local and global feature understanding
- Requirement for explainable predictions
- Computational constraints for deployment

### 1.3 Objectives

1. Develop automated classification system with >90% accuracy
2. Achieve real-time inference (<100ms per image)
3. Handle class-imbalanced medical datasets
4. Provide interpretable results for clinical use
5. Deploy cost-effective solution

## 2. Data Description

### 2.1 Dataset Overview

- **Source:** COVID-19 Radiography Database
- **Total Images:** 21,165 chest X-rays
- **Format:** JPEG, PNG (various resolutions)
- **Classes:** 4 categories
- **Collection Period:** 2019-2024

### 2.2 Class Distribution

| Class | Count | Percentage |

| Viral Pneumonia | 1,493 | 7.1% |
| **Total** | **21,165** | **100%** |

**Challenge:** Significant class imbalance (7.1% to 48.2%)

### 2.3 Data Quality Issues

- Variable image resolutions (256×256 to 4096×4096)
- Different acquisition protocols
- Varying contrast and brightness levels
- Presence of artifacts and annotations
- Missing metadata in some cases

5. Normalize to [0, 1]
    ↓
Processed Image
```

### 3.2 Data Augmentation Strategy

Applied to training set only:

- **Rotation:** ±20 degrees randomly
- **Zoom:** 80% to 120% scale
- **Contrast:** 80% to 120% adjustment
- **Result:** 3× effective training data

### 3.3 Handling Class Imbalance

**Approach 1: SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling)**
- Generated synthetic samples for minority classes
- Balanced dataset: 10,192 samples per class
- Used for training only

**Approach 2: Class Weights**
- Weighted loss function: w_i = N / (C × n_i)
- Normal: 0.52
- COVID-19: 1.47
- Bacterial: 1.91
- Viral: 3.56

### 3.4 Data Split

| Split | Samples | Percentage | Purpose |
|-------|---------|------------|---------|
| Training | 14,815 | 70% | Model training |
| Validation | 3,175 | 15% | Hyperparameter tuning |
| Testing | 3,175 | 15% | Final evaluation |
